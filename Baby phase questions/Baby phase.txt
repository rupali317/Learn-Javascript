1. Name the primitive values in JavaScript
Ans: 1. Number (values include integers like -23, 0, 6, 1000, Decimal numbers 45.89, -98.8)

2. Boolean (values can only be true / false)

3. String (alphanumeric values inside quotes "" or '' such as '45 things', 'Hello', "---___---")

4. Null (a value that is deliberately assigned to a variable but this value is nothing). typeof null is "object" (historical bug)

5. Undefined (when a variable is declared it does not have any value assigned to it. The value in that variable is not defined and hence the variable is considered undefined)

6. BigInt (Drawback with number is that there is a limitation on the max/min number. beyond that if those big numbers are to be used for calculation then it will lead to incorrect results. That is when we need BigInt. 123n is a bigint type. It can also be created using the comstructor such as BigInt(4) = 4n)

7. Symbol (Symbols provide a unique indentifier for a variable
eg const sym1 = Symbol() and const sym2 = Symbol(), so sym1 and sym2 can never be the same
Symbols are usually handy for uniquely identifying keys)

2. What are variables? 
Ans: variables are places to store/modify/retrieve values

3. Why do we need variables? 
Ans: Variables can be reused throughtout the code, They represent a value

4. How do you declare variables? 
Ans: const variable_name, let var123, var variable123

5. How do you assign variables? 
Ans: const variable_name = 123, let var123 = 'str', var variable123 = false

6. What’s the difference between const, let and var? 
Ans: const -> once you declare a variable using const, you have to assign it. Once a const variable is assigned you cannot modify the value. You cannot access a const variable before its initialisation since the area is considered temporal dead zone and accessing it will throw an error
console.log(a) // error: TDZ
const a = 123 // 'a' cannot be hoisted
let -> You cannot access a let variable before its initialisation since the area is considered temporal dead zone and accessing it will throw an error (variables with 'let' keyword cannot be hoisted). 
console.log(a) // error: TDZ
let a = 123 // 'a' cannot be hoisted
When you declare a variable using let, it is not necessary to initialise it. When you initialise a variable with let keyword you can always change the value
var -> When you declare a variable using var, it is not necessary to initialise it. When you initialise a variable with var  keyword you can always change the value. Variables with var can be hoisted means you can use the variable even before declaring it
console.log(a) // undefined
var a = 123;

7. What does each of the following operators do?
+ (adds numbers eg 2+3=5, joins at least one string eg 2+'3'='23', '3'+2='32', '3'+'2'='32')
- (subtracts two numbers eg 2-3=-1, 3-2=1)
* (multiplies two numbers 2*3=6)
/ (divides two numbers 3/3 = 1)
% (gives the remainder when the numbers are divided 1%1 = 0)

8. What does each of the following comparison operators do?
=== ( checks if the left hand and right hand values are equal in value as well as the type, eg 2 === 2 will return true since the values are equal and the type is number for both. But '2'=== 2 is false because the type is different. '2' is string and 2 is number even though the value is equal)
!== (returns true if the left hand value and right hand value are not equal in value or not equal in type. 
Eg: 2 !== 2 => false;
'2' !== 2 => true; Value is same but type is different so yes they are not equal
3 !== 2 => true; Type is same but values are not same so they are not equal
'3' !== '2' => true; Values are different and type are different so yes they are not equal
)
> (Returns true when the value on left is greater than the value on the right)
>= (Returns true when the value on left is greater than or equal to the value on the right)
< (Returns true when the value on left is lesser than the value on the right)
<= (Returns true when the value on left is lesser than or equal to the value on the right)
== (Checks if only the value in left hand and right hand are the same. It does not check for the type.
Eg: 2 == 2 -> true; 2 == '2' -> true even though the data type is different but the values are the same. The value is converted to one type to do the comparison. In this case '2' is converted to 2 to do the comparison)
!= (Returns true if the values are not matching. Type is ignored. 2 != 3 -> true 2 != '2' -> false)
== and != invove type coercion whereas === and !== do not

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9. What is an if statement?
Ans: if(condition) {
    staments to execute
}
if the condition within the if is true then the statment is executed. If false then the statements within the if are not executed

10. When do you use an if statement?
Ans: If we need certain statements to be executed based on a condition
Eg -> 
if(human) {
    console.log("You are a human")
}
if(age >= 30) {
    console.log("Greater than or equal to 30")
} else {
    console.log("Lesser than 30")
}
If human is true then "You are a human" is printed. If false then the console statement is not printed
In the next if-else pair, if age >= 30 is true then "Greater than or equal to 30" is printed. If age >= 30 is false, then "Lesser than 30" is printed

11. When should you use if, else if, and else?
if (If the condition turns out to be true then if statement is executed)
else if (if the if condition fails then the control looks for series of conditions within else if to see if they satisy the condition, once it satisies an else if condition, then only the statement within that else if is executed)
else (If all conditions fail in if, else if then else will be executed)

12. How do you write if, else if, and else?
Ans:
if(age > 30) {
    console.log("Hello old people")
} else if(age <= 30 && age > 20) {
    console.log("Hello kidults")
} else if(age <= 18 && age > 12) {
    console.log("Hello teenager")
} else {
    console.log("Hey kid")
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

13. What is an object?
Ans: Object holds data in key-value format. Typical use case includes a data holding certain attributes and methods
     Eg: 
    const person = {    eyes: 2, 
                        'Max age': 122, 
                        'Min age': 0,
                        walk:function(){
                            console.log('walk')
                        }
                    }

14. Why do you use objects?
Ans: If you need to represent data as key value pairs and especially if data can be represented as having attributes and/or functionalities/methods.

15. How do you put values into objects?
Ans: Considering the above const person example, there are 2 ways of putting the values:
- person.legs = 2
- person["legs"] = 2

16. How do you get values out of objects?
Ans: There are 2 ways of getting the values:
person.eyes // will return 2
person['Max age'] // will return 122 
person.Max age will not work.That's why the bracket notation exists for a reason. Bracket notation enables us to store property names that are usually not allowed in dot notations. Even variable names can be used in bracket notation but will not work as expected in dot notations

17. How do you remove a property from an object?
Ans: There are 2 ways of deleting a property from an object
delete person['eyes']
detete person.eyes

18. What is a method on an object?
Ans: The value of a property can also be a function. This function is called method. The person object has a method defined as walk key. 

19.How do you define methods?
Ans: const person = {    eyes: 2, 
                        'Max age': 122, 
                        'Min age': 0,
                        walk:function(){
                            console.log('walk')
                        }
                    }

20. How do you call/invoke a method?
Ans: there are 2 ways of invoking a method
person.walk()
person['walk']()

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

21. What is a function?
Ans: A function holds logic that can potentially be repeated in various places. Logic that does specific things can be grouped in a function.

22. Why do you use functions?
Ans: First functions need to be declared before calling it

23. How do you define functions?
Ans: There are 3 ways of defining a function
-> Function declarations
function functionName(param1) {
    console.log("Function name"+param1)
}
param1 is optional

-> Function expression
const functionExp = function () {
    console.log("Function expression")
}

-> Arrow function
const arrowExp = () => {
    return "arrow"
}
const arrowExp = _ => "arrow" // This is an implicit return

24. How do you call/invoke/execute functions?
Ans: Based from the function definitions in 23,
-> functionName("hi") // "hi" is an arguments
-> functionExp()
-> arrowExp()

25. How do you pass arguments into a function?
Ans: Passing primitive/complex values within the () braces of a function call. Eg: functionName("hi")

26. What does the return keyword do in a function?
Ans: First, when return is encountered, the execution of that function stops at return, meaning any statements after the return within the function will not be executed. It returns the value back to the caller of the function. If a function does not have a return statement then undefined is returned
