1. Name the primitive values in JavaScript
Ans: 1. Number (values include integers like -23, 0, 6, 1000, Decimal numbers 45.89, -98.8)

2. Boolean (values can only be true / false)

3. String (alphanumeric values inside quotes "" or '' such as '45 things', 'Hello', "---___---")

4. Null (a value that is deliberately assigned to a variable but this value is nothing)

5. Undefined (when a variable is declared it does not have any value assigned to it. The value in that variable is not defined and hence the variable is considered undefined)

6. BigInt (Drawback with number is that there is a limitation on the max/min number. beyond that if those big numbers are to be used for calculation then it will lead to incorrect results. That is when we need BigInt. BigInt(4) = 4n)

7. Symbol (Symbols provide a unique indentifier for a variable
eg const sym1 = Symbol() and const sym2 = Symbol(), so sym1 and sym2 can never be the same
Symbols are usually handy for uniquely identifying keys)

2. What are variables? 
Ans: variables are places to store/modify/retrieve values

3. Why do we need variables? 
Ans: Variables can be reused throughtout the code, They represent a value

4. How do you declare variables? 
Ans: const variable_name, let var123, var variable123

5. How do you assign variables? 
Ans: const variable_name = 123, let var123 = 'str', var variable123 = false

6. What’s the difference between const, let and var? 
Ans: const -> once you declare a variable using const, you have to assign it. Once a const variable is assigned you cannot modify the value. You cannot access a const variable before its initialisation since the area is considered temporal dead zone and accessing it will throw an error
console.log(a) // error: TDZ
const a = 123 // 'a' cannot be hoisted
let -> You cannot access a let variable before its initialisation since the area is considered temporal dead zone and accessing it will throw an error (variables with 'let' keyword cannot be hoisted). 
console.log(a) // error: TDZ
let a = 123 // 'a' cannot be hoisted
When you declare a variable using let, it is not necessary to initialise it. When you initialise a variable with let keyword you can always change the value
var -> When you declare a variable using var, it is not necessary to initialise it. When you initialise a variable with var  keyword you can always change the value. Variables with var can be hoisted means you can use the variable even before declaring it
console.log(a) // undefined
var a = 123;

7. What does each of the following operators do?
+ (adds numbers eg 2+3=5, joins at least one string eg 2+'3'='23', '3'+2='32', '3'+'2'='32')
- (subtracts two numbers eg 2-3=-1, 3-2=1)
* (multiplies two numbers 2*3=6)
/ (divides two numbers 3/3 = 1)
% (gives the remainder when the numbers are divided 1%1 = 0)

8. What does each of the following comparison operators do?
=== ( checks if the left hand and right hand values are equal in value as well as the type, eg 2 === 2 will return true since the values are equal and the type is number for both. But '2'===2 is false because the type is different. '2' is string and 2 is number even though the value is equal)
!== (returns true if the left hand value and right hand value are not equal in value or not equal in type. 
Eg: 2 !== 2 => false;
'2' !== 2 => true; Value is same but type is different so yes they are not equal
3 !== 2 => true; Type is same but values are not same so they are not equal
'3' !== '2' => true; Values are different and type are different so yes they are not equal
)
> (Returns true when the value on left is greater than the value on the right)
>= (Returns true when the value on left is greater than or equal to the value on the right)
< (Returns true when the value on left is lesser than the value on the right)
<= (Returns true when the value on left is lesser than or equal to the value on the right)

9. What is an if statement?
Ans: 

10. When do you use an if statement?
Ans:

11. When should you use if, else if, and else?
if ()
else if ()
else ()

12. How do you write if, else if, and else?
Ans:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

13. What is an object?
Ans: Object holds data in key-value format. Typical use case includes a data holding certain attributes and methods
     Eg: 
    const person = {    eyes: 2, 
                        'Max age': 122, 
                        'Min age': 0,
                        walk:function(){
                            console.log('walk')
                        }
                    }

14. Why do you use objects?
Ans: If you need to represent data as key value pairs and especially if data can be represented as having attributes and/or functionalities/methods.

15. How do you put values into objects?
Ans: Considering the above const person example, there are 2 ways of putting the values:
- person.legs = 2
- person["legs"] = 2

16. How do you get values out of objects?
Ans: There are 2 ways of getting the values:
person.eyes // will return 2
person['Max age'] // will return 122 
person.Max age will not work.That's why the bracket notation exists for a reason. Bracket notation enables us to store property names that are usually not allowed in dot notations. Even variable names can be used in bracket notation but will not work as expected in dot notations

17. How do you remove a property from an object?
Ans: There are 2 ways of deleting a property from an object
delete person['eyes']
detete person.eyes

18. What is a method on an object?
Ans: The value of a property can also be a function. This function is called method. The person object has a method defined as walk key. 

19.How do you define methods?
Ans: const person = {    eyes: 2, 
                        'Max age': 122, 
                        'Min age': 0,
                        walk:function(){
                            console.log('walk')
                        }
                    }

20. How do you call/invoke a method?
Ans: there are 2 ways of invoking a method
person.walk()
person['walk']()

23. How do you define functions?
24. How do you call/invoke/execute functions?
25. How do you pass arguments into a function?
26. What does the return keyword do in a function?
