1. Name the primitive values in JavaScript
Ans: 1. Number (values include integers like -23, 0, 6, 1000, Decimal numbers 45.89, -98.8)

2. Boolean (values can only be true / false)

3. String (alphanumeric values inside quotes "" or '' such as '45 things', 'Hello', "---___---")

4. Null (a value that is deliberately assigned to a variable but this value is nothing)

5. Undefined (when a variable is declared it does not have any value assigned to it. The value in that variable is not defined
and hence the variable is considered undefined)

6. BigInt (Drawback with number is that there is a limitation on the max/min number. beyond that if those big numbers are to 
be used for calculation then it will lead to incorrect results. That is when we need BigInt. BigInt(4) = 4n)

7. Symbol (Symbols provide a unique indentifier for a variable
eg const sym1 = Symbol() and const sym2 = Symbol(), so sym1 and sym2 can never be the same
Symbols are usually handy for uniquely identifying keys)

2. What are variables? variables are places to store/modify/retrieve values

3. Why do we need variables? Variables can be reused throughtout the code, They represent a value

4. How do you declare variables? const variable_name, let var123, var variable123

5. How do you assign variables? const variable_name = 123, let var123 = 'str', var variable123 = false

6. What’s the difference between const, let and var? const -> once you declare a variable using const, you have to assign it. 
Once a const variable is assigned you cannot modify the value. You cannot access a const variable before its initialisation since
the area is considered temporal dead zone and accessing it will throw an error
console.log(a) // error: TDZ
const a = 123 // 'a' cannot be hoisted
let -> You cannot access a let variable before its initialisation since the area is considered temporal dead zone and 
accessing it will throw an error (variables with 'let' keyword cannot be hoisted). 
console.log(a) // error: TDZ
let a = 123 // 'a' cannot be hoisted
When you declare a variable using let, it is not necessary to initialise it. When you initialise
a variable with let keyword you can always change the value
var -> When you declare a variable using var, it is not necessary to initialise it. When you initialise a variable with var 
keyword you can always change the value. Variables with var can be hoisted means you can use the variable even before declaring it
console.log(a) // undefined
var a = 123;

7. What does each of the following operators do?
+ (adds numbers eg 2+3=5, joins at least one string eg 2+'3'='23', '3'+2='32', '3'+'2'='32')
- (subtracts two numbers eg 2-3=-1, 3-2=1)
* (multiplies two numbers 2*3=6)
/ (divides two numbers 3/3 = 1)
% (gives the remainder when the numbers are divided 1%1 = 0)

8. What does each of the following comparison operators do?
=== ( checks if the left hand and right hand values are equal in value as well as the type, eg 2 === 2 will return true since the
values are equal and the type is number for both. But '2'===2 is false because the type is different. '2' is string and 2 is number
even though the value is equal)
!== (returns true if the left hand value and right hand value are not equal in value or not equal in type. 
Eg: 2 !== 2 => false;
'2' !== 2 => true; Value is same but type is different so yes they are not equal
3 !== 2 => true; Type is same but values are not same so they are not equal
'3' !== '2' => true; Values are different and type are different so yes they are not equal
)
> (Returns true when the value on left is greater than the value on the right)
>= (Returns true when the value on left is greater than or equal to the value on the right)
< (Returns true when the value on left is lesser than the value on the right)
<= (Returns true when the value on left is lesser than or equal to the value on the right)
