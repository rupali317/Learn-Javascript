1. What is a callback?
Ans: A callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function, these callbacks are called later within the callback accepting function. Callbacks are handy when we want certain logic to be executed only after another logic is handled. If the ordering matters for the logic to be executed where one function is dependent on the other function then callback is handy in this scenario. Moreover, if you do not want to block the stack the callback is handy.

For instance, buttons have an event listener where when we click on the button, the callback function gets executed. It does not block the entire page. We are free to interact with other content of the page. Only when the click happens on the button, the callback gets executed. Without callback, the program would block the entire stack while waiting for a click. There is no guarantee that the click will happen

Callbacks can be used synchronously (callback run immediately) and asynchronously (button click example as explanied above - callback not run immediately. It is waiting for an event)

2. How do you use a callback?
// Function declaration of a callback
function callback() {
    console.log("I am a callback")
}

// Function declaration of a callback accepting function
function callbackAcceptingFunction(cb) {
    console.log("Body of callback accepting function. Now I will execute the callback")
    cb() // The callback is executed
}

// executing callback accepting function
callbackAcceptingFunction(callback)

3. How do you write a function that accepts a callback?

4. What is an Element?
Ans: elememt is a type of a node in the concept of DOM. It represents all the HTML tags

5. What is a Node?
Ans: If we represent the HTML as object, we get the document object model (as a tree), where document is the root (which is a node). and then there are leaves such as nodes. Every element is a node, texts are different types of node
Eg: Consider the following HTML code snippet
<div>
 <p>Hello world<p>
</div>

div (Element node)
|___p (Element node)
    |___Hello world (Text node)

div is a node (Element type)
p is a node (Element type)
Hello world is a node as well  (Text type)

6. How do you select an element?
Ans: document.querySelector("p") Within the brackets, you can have: "#id", ".classname". But this will select only one element in the DOM. NOTE: Usually we usually document to do selection since document is the root. But in place of document it can be an element as well.
document.getElementById("id")


7. How do you select multiple elements?
Ans: document.querySelectorAll("p")
document.getElementsByClassName("classname")
document.getElementsByTagName("p")
NOTE: Usually we usually document to do selection since document is the root. But in place of document it can be an element as well.

8. How do you loop through multiple elements for all browsers?
Ans: const paragraphs = document.querySelectorAll("p")

There are 3 ways to loop:
-> for loop
for(let i = 0; i < paragraphs.length; i++) {
    console.log(paragraphs[i])
}

-> for...of..
for(let paragraph of paragraphs) {
    console.log(paragraph)
}

-> forEach, it uses callback 
paragraphs.forEach(paragraph => console.log(paragraph))

9. How do you add a class to an element?
Ans: Element.classList.add("class-name")
Element.classList.add("class-name1", "class-name2")

10. How do you remove a class from an element?
Ans: Element.classList.remove("class-name")
Elememt.classList.remove("class-name1", "class-name2")

11. How do you check if a class is present on an element?
Ans: if(Element.classList.contains("class-name")) {
    console.log("present")
}

12. When should you add a class to an element?
Ans: When you need that element to behave or look differently depending on your use case. For example, to toggle a menu sidebar by clicking on a button. On clicking a button you would first want the sidebar to show up and then close on the next click. Hiding and showing of the sodebar can be done using class to the sidebar element
